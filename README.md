[00:09.96] If you're not the one for me
[00:14.50] Then how come I can bring you to your knees?
[00:19.89] If you're not the one for me
[00:24.55] Why do I hate the idea of being free?
[00:43.05] 
[00:29.98] And if I'm not the one for you
[00:34.39] You've gotta stop holding me the way you do
[00:39.65] Oh, honey, if I'm not the one for you
[00:44.04] Why have we been through what we have been through?
[01:09.54] 
[00:49.64] It's so cold out here in your wilderness
[00:59.94] I want you to be my keeper
[01:05.34] But not if you are so reckless
[01:20.34] 
[01:10.18] If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
[01:13.44] Don't pretend that you don't want me
[01:15.91] Our love ain't water under the bridge
[01:20.07] If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
[01:23.32] Don't pretend that you don't want me
[01:25.92] Our love ain't water under the bridge
[01:30.14] Woah-woah
[01:35.16] Say that our love ain't water under the bridge
[01:58.16] 
[01:41.67] What are you waiting for?
[01:44.99] You never seem to make it through the door
[01:50.68] And who are you hiding from?
[01:55.02] It ain't no life to live like you're on the run
[02:00.82] Have I ever asked for much?
[02:05.48] The only thing that I want is your love
[02:24.98] 
[02:10.88] If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
[02:13.90] Don't pretend that you don't want me
[02:16.11] Our love ain't water under the bridge
[02:20.76] If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
[02:24.13] Don't pretend that you don't want me
[02:26.77] Our love ain't water under the bridge
[02:31.62] Woah-woah
[02:36.15] Say that our love ain't water under the bridge
[02:59.15] 
[02:40.75] It's so cold in your wilderness
[02:50.88] I want you to be my keeper
[02:56.47] But not if you are so reckless
[03:11.47] 
[03:02.76] If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
[03:05.67] Don't pretend that you don't want me
[03:08.26] Our love ain't water under the bridge
[03:12.72] If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
[03:15.81] Don't pretend that you don't want me
[03:18.25] Our love ain't water under the bridge
[03:36.75] 
[03:23.04] (Say it ain't so, say it ain't so)
[03:25.48] (Say it ain't so, say it ain't so)
[03:28.05] Say that our love ain't water under the bridge
[03:33.09] (Say it ain't so, say it ain't so)
[03:35.82] (Say it ain't so, say it ain't so)
[03:37.98] Say that our love ain't water under the bridge
[04:00.98] 
[03:48.03] Say that our love ain't water under the bridge
